After deliberation, this should probably contain configs that are separate from the actual media files. Mostly because I don't really know when google is going to change the API or status messages. Is it a good idea? IDK. suggestions from the internet are to keep constants as close as possible to their usages. That makes sense, but these are sorta related to the message formats that google are using, so I'm reluctant.
