## Details

You create a screen object that can be used by the youtube lounge/leanback api to use using the chromecast connection. This has a unique screen ID.

Then you create a lounge token based on this screen ID using the loungeToken API.

Then you bind the loungeToken and the screenID using the bind API and then it'll return a gsession and session ID.

You then construct requests to the bind API to play videos/add videos to queue, etc.

Commands supported are:

- initialize playlist.
- add as next video in playlist.
- add video to back of playlist.
- remove video from playlist.

See examples folder to find out how to use.
